#  Great Learning Lab 5 - College Fest

This repo contains the project **Great Learning Back-End Development Lab 5 - College Fest**. This is a Spring MVC application developed for [**E&ICT IIT Roorkee: Advanced Certificate Program in Full Stack Software Development**](https://www.greatlearning.in/advanced-certification-full-stack-software-development-iit-roorkee) certification.

##  Problem Statement

In College fest, Students want to take registrations for a Debate event and want to keep track of student details based on the department. You are required to create a web application, where you will be developing CRUD(Create Read Update Delete) functionality.

##  Working with College Fest in the Eclipse IDE

###  Prerequisites

The following items should be installed in your system:

* Java 11 or newer

* Eclipse IDE 2021-12

* Apache Tomcat 9.0.55

###  URL

This Spring MVC application, after running it on the server, can be accessed at the URL http://localhost:8080/CollegeFest/students/list where 8080 is the port number of the Tomcat Server. If your Tomcat Server port number is different than 8080 kindly replace the 8080 in URL with your Tomcat Port Number.

##  Database configuration

- The College Fest Management uses the MySQL database. It uses the default port for MySQL i.e. `3306` and the Database name is `collegefest`

- To create the database use the [CollegeFest.sql](https://github.com/shubhamshukla7794/ShubhamKShukla_Spring_MVCLabSolution/blob/main/CollegeFest.sql "CollegeFest.sql") script

- Change the **username** and **password** in the [college-fest-mvc-servlet.xml](https://github.com/shubhamshukla7794/ShubhamKShukla_Spring_MVCLabSolution/blob/main/CollegeFest/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/college-fest-mvc-servlet.xml "college-fest-mvc-servlet.xml") to match your **username** and **password** of MySQL
